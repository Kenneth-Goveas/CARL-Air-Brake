# CARL Air Brake

The *CARL Air Brake* computer is a flight computer that automatically controls a
rocket air brake in flight, so that the vehicle attains an apogee at the desired
altitude. This is a master repository that contains all the electronic hardware
designs and software for the CARL Air Brake computer.

**NOTE**: *This repository is currently work-in-progress. An older version of
the CARL Air Brake was already flown once. Currently, the hardware designs are
being updated and the software is being restructured and improved. Once this is
done, they will each be available in separate repositories, all included inside
this one as submodules. For now, the in-progress work can be accessed through
the following links.*
